//!
//! Task used to (fast) simulate the performance of measurement devices.
//! This is NOT a full performance simulator such as GEANT.  Instead, it uses
//! simplified models of (a) the efficiency of detection for the particles of interest in the measurement(s) and
//! (b) it simulates the measurement performance, i.e., the bias and resolution of the measurements
//! with fast simulators. The task first reviews which particles are accepted and considered "measured" using filters  implementing
//! the ParticleFilterEfficiency class. If accepted, particles are submitted to a smearer implementing the ParticlePerformanceSimulator
//! class and the momentum (pt, eta, and phi) of each accepted/detected particle is then smeared.
//! Particles that are accepted and smeared are inserted in event stream 1 (generator level particles are in stream 0).
//! It is then possible for performance analysis tasks to direct compare particles of the two stream,
//! carry out closure tests and so on.
//!
//!Configuration parameters of the MeasurementPerformanceSimulator class are as follows
//!
//!
//!
